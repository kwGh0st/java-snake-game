# Snake Game in Java

The Snake Game in Java is a classic gaming experience where the player controls a snake aiming to collect apples while avoiding collisions with its own body and the board's boundaries. The game is event-driven, ensuring smooth snake movement and responsiveness to player interactions.

## Overview

This game is implemented in Java using the Swing library to create the user interface. Its core features include:
- Control of a snake using arrow keys to navigate the board.
- Objective: Collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions.
- Real-time display of the score on the board, tracking the number of eaten apples.
- Game ends upon collision with the walls or the snake's body.

## Features

- Player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys.
- Visual display of the game board and snake movement.
- Scoring system to track the number of collected apples.
- Event-driven mechanism ensuring smooth snake movement and responsiveness.

    - → (Right) - Move the snake to the right.
3. Eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the snake's body or the board's boundaries.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the board's boundaries.

## Implementation Details

The game is implemented using Java and the Swing library for the graphical user interface. It's based on an event-driven mechanism to ensure smooth snake movement and real-time response to player interactions.

## Planned Enhancements
